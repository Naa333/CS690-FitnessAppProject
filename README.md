## Scenario: A Day in the Life of Yusuf

### Morning

Yusuf wakes up and looks in the mirror. “I need to get back into a fitness routine,” he thinks, tying his sneakers for a quick jog. Halfway through, he wonders, “How far did I run last time? Should I push for more today?”

He realizes he didn’t log his last workout and has no way of knowing if he’s improving.

 

### Late Morning

At work, Yusuf’s friend Elena talks about her workout plan. “I do strength training on Mondays, yoga on Wednesdays, and cardio on Fridays,” she says. Yusuf nods, thinking that sounds great but admits, “I never know where to start when I hit the gym.”

 

### Lunch

Over lunch, Yusuf scrolls through a fitness app and feels overwhelmed by the number of options. “I just need something simple to plan and track my workouts,” he mutters, closing the app without starting anything.

 

### Afternoon

On the way home, Yusuf stops by a sports store to buy new resistance bands. Standing in the aisle, he hesitates. “What exercises can I even do with these?” he wonders. He buys them anyway but knows he might forget to use them.

 

### Evening

Back home, Yusuf flips through his notebook, looking for an old workout routine. He finds scribbled sets and reps but no dates or progress logs. “If I could just plan and track my workouts better, I’d stay consistent,” he sighs.
